# StockPricePredictor

The goal of this project was to use LSTM to predict closing stock prices of a given company. Yahoo finance was used to obtain closing stock price history and all the data were normalized. An LSTM model was then build and then trained with the normalized data. The accuracy of the predicted closing stock prices was then assessed using root mean square error (RMSE)
